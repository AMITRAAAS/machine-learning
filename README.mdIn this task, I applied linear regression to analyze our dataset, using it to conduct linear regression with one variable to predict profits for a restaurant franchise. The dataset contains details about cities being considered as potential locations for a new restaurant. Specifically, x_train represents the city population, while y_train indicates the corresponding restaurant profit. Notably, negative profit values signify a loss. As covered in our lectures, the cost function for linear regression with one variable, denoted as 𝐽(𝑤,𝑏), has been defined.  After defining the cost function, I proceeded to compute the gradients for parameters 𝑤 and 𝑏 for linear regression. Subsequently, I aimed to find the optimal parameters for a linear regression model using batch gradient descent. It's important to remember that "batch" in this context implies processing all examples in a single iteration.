In this task, I applied linear regression to analyze our dataset, using it to conduct linear regression with one variable to predict profits for a restaurant franchise. The dataset contains details about cities being considered as potential locations for a new restaurant. Specifically, x_train represents the city population, while y_train indicates the corresponding restaurant profit. Notably, negative profit values signify a loss. As covered in our lectures, the cost function for linear regression with one variable, denoted as 𝐽(𝑤,𝑏), has been defined.

After defining the cost function, I proceeded to compute the gradients for parameters 𝑤 and 𝑏 for linear regression. Subsequently, I aimed to find the optimal parameters for a linear regression model using batch gradient descent. It's important to remember that "batch" in this context implies processing all examples in a single iteration.
